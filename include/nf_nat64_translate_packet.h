 * Using the "l3protocol" layer 3 protocol, the "l4protocol" layer 4
 * protocol, and assuming that the "skb" incoming packet brought about the
 * "outgoing" tuple, returns the packet the Nat64 should send to the
 * outgoing network.
 *
 * If "skb" (the incoming packet) was a hairpin packet, set "hairpin" as
 * "true".
 *
 * The whole 3.7 section of RFC 6146 is encapsulated in this function.
